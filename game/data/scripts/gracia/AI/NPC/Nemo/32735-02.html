Here is the Maguen Plasma Collector.<br>
Remember these rules:<br>
1. Collect <font color="LEVEL">one of each type</font>, or <font color="LEVEL">several of the same type</font>.<br>
2. Collecting random Maguen Plasmas can overload the Plasma Collector and will release any plasma you have collected. Yes, this means you'll have to start all over again.
