<html><body>Brother Metheus:<br>
Come in, Dark Elf. Do you know why I've asked you here? Once I had a beloved sister. She was the only family I had left. She was executed during the rebellion of farmers because of her relationship with the Bishops. And this after she was excommunicated! The High Priest said that her soul would be damned and her body could not be buried in consecrated ground!<br>
Einhasad teaches forgiveness and mercy but I cannot suppress the furious sadness in my heart.<br>
I must have revenge on those who killed my sister!<br>
If you will help me avenge my sister, I will take the skull of Brother Alders from the crypt in the temple. There are two things with which I need your help.<font color="LEVEL"> First, locate my sister's remains in the Execution Grounds</font>. Her body hangs from the branches of a tree. This is no normal tree, but a fearsome creature of the undead called <font color="LEVEL">Hangman Tree</font>. Once you retrieve my sister's remains, put them in this pot and bring them to me.
