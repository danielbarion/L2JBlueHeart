So you have also come for the blood-colored Fairy Dust! I can't give it to you for free! Do me a favor, though, and I will give it to you. Listen carefully!<br>
Our queen's hobby is collecting skulls. She delights in displaying strange-looking skulls from rare species. Personally, I find it a repulsive hobby. But she's our queen, after all -- what can I do?<br>
She lacks the skulls of a <font color="LEVEL">Grandis, Karul Bugbear, Breka Orc Overlord and Leto Lizardman Overlord</font>. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">one skull from each</font> of them and I will give you the Red Fairy Dust in return. I swear on this jewel!<br>
You will find a Grandis in Death Pass.<br1>Karul Bugbears will be in Hunters Valley.<br1>You will find Breka Orc Overlords in Breka's Stronghold.<br1>And the Leto Lizardman Overlord will be on the Plains of the Lizardmen.
