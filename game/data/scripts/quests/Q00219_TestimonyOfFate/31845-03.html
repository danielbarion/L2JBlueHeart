<html><body>Bloody Pixy:<br>
Our queen lacks the skulls of a <font color="LEVEL">Grandis, Karul Bugbear, Breka Orc Overlord and Leto Lizardman Overlord</font>. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">one skull from each</font> of them and I will give you the Red Fairy Dust in return. I promised on the jewel, didn't I? Pixies always keep their word! Should I tell you where you will find the creatures again?<br>
You will find a Grandis in Death Pass.<br1>Karul Bugbears will be in Hunters Valley.<br1>You will find Breka Orc Overlords in Breka's Stronghold.<br1>And the Leto Lizardman Overlords will be on the Plains of the Lizardmen.
