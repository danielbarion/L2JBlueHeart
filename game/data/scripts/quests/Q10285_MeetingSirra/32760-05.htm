I am not sure. As I told you before, I fear that Felicia may be lost forever, since she froze even her best friend Kier. 
But it's possible Felicia's soul still exists somewhere within the Ice Queen, weakening Freya. 
We have an idea - we might strengthen Felicia's spirit through some sort of medium that can absorb the Ice Queen's power, 
thus weakening Freya's grasp on Felicia's body.<br>
