Well done. You've done well in a very dangerous task.<br>
What's that ...? He cried out <font color="LEVEL">Beleth's</font> name as he died...? Beleth was a Dark Mage who was called a demon a long time ago and whose powers were sealed by the magicians of the Ivory Tower. But whether he lived or died has never been confirmed. A demon who follows Beleth has appeared on this island... That's just not right. I get the feeling that this event is just the beginning of a greater calamity...<br>
But then... What is this <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Tablet</font>? Was this obtained from the demon? That looks like the sort used by mages in the Elmoreden age. What does this have to do with Beleth? ... I suppose I must ask Gallint of the Einhovant's School, who can read the ancient language, to translate this for me...<br>
Oh! I was so wrapped up in thinking about this that I almost forgot something important. Please accept this. It is a small token of appreciation for completing such a difficult task. Please don't refuse me, and take it.
