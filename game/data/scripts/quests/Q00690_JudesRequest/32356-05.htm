Ah! By my count, you have collected less than <font color="LEVEL">200</font> Evil Weapons. You can obtain more from the <font color="LEVEL">Lesser Evils and Greater Evils in the Monster Foundry</font>. Do your best! If you collect <font color="LEVEL">200 Evil Weapons</font>, I will exchange them for the S80 Grade weapon recipe. If you prefer, I can also exchange 5 Evil Weapons for 3 S80 Grade weapon pieces right now.<br>
