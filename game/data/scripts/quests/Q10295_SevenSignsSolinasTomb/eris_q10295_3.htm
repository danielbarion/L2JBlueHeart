Sister of Silence Eris:<br>

Everyone who comes to the room, except the creators of the print mechanism - 
Eris Kaeruna, Solina and Anays, are considered invaders. But I'm just a spirit that can not leave from this room, so I can not help you more. 
You just have to destroy the press. To do this, you will have to battle the four Guardians of Treasure.
