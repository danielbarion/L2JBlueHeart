Sister of Silence Eris:<br>

The Seal of Saintess, protecting Solina's casket room, consists on 4 Guardians and 4 Powerful Devices.
 The Guardians, endowed with power from the Powerful Devices, can cancel any damage as long as the Powerful
 Device is running. In order to defeat them, you have to weaken the power of the Guardians by removing 4 Powerful 
Devices. It sounds impossible but there is no other way to meet Solina. <br>
