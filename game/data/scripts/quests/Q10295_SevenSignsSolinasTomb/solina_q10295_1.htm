Elmore-Aden's Saintess Solina:<br>
Ah, at last... We finally meet. I have waited for you for a very long time. You are foretold in Einhasad's prophecy, did you know that?<br>
I'm grateful for you, I imagine your journey here must have been difficult.<br>
I'm too tired. My soul looks for peace but I cannot be at peace until I speak to you that which will save the world.<br>
