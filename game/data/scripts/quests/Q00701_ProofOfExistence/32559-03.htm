We think that what the soldiers saw might have been a monster called <font color="LEVEL">Banshee Queen Enira</font>. If so, that would be a dangerous enemy. In can create fear using <font color="LEVEL">Floating Zombies</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Floating Skulls</font>.<br>
Still, experienced soldiers shouldn't be reduced to a gaggle of frightened children! If I weren't needed here to safeguard the Barrier Orb, I'd go deal with this myself. Since I can't go, I need a skilled adventurer. How about it? With your ability, I'm you can handle whatever you encounter out there.<br>
