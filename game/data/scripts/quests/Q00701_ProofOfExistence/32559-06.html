Ah! You're back? What's this? You couldn't defeat that vile monster? That's unfortunate, but a promise is a promise. Here's a reward for your other efforts in this matter. But you're not giving up already, are you? Please destroy <font color="LEVEL">Banshee Queen Enira</font>! I'll also reward you for eliminating the <font color="LEVEL">Floating Skulls and Floating Zombies</font>. Just remember, you'll have to go at night. Are you ready?<br>
