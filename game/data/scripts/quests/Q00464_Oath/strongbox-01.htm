You find an old book inside.<br>
You open it and turn to the first page, and see a picture that obviously harkens back to ancient times. This book is old, that is for sure.<br>
You read a note scrawled in perfect penmanship: <font color="LEVEL">To Sophia of the Library of Sages</font>. Perhaps she will know what to do with the book.
