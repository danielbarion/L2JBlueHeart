You'll really do it? I knew today was a good day. I'll tell you about the Lienrik.<br>
The Lienrik dwells near the <font color="LEVEL">Rest Area of the Animals</font>. There's the Lienrik and the Lienrik Lad. One has a range attack and one spews poison up close.<br>
Both have the <font color="LEVEL">Lienrik Egg</font>. That's where the fun begins: The egg determines gender, with the females being the most valuable.<br>
I can't pay money for one, but I'll definitely offer a reward. Bring back as many as you can.<br>
I might even let you keep one~
