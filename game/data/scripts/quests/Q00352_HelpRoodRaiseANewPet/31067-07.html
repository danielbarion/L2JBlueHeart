Ready to do this? Today is a lucky day for both of us! Let me repeat what I told you earlier about Lienrik.<br>Both Lienrik and Lienrik Lads can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Rest Area of the Animals</font>. Approach both carefully, as once can spew poison from a great distance.<br>
Both kinds lay <font color="LEVEL">eggs</font>, but finding a female Lienrik is very rare.<br>
Well, if you can do this for me, I'll make it worth your while -- I promise!<br>
Even bringing back one would make my day!
