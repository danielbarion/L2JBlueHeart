It is no easy task for any outsider to come and find the Elroki tribe these days. Personally, I have no quarrel with outsiders, but I can't say that our warriors share that sentiment.<br>
In any event, you have invaded the chief's barracks, and that is an insult for which they will wish to punish you... perhaps harshly. This is your last chance -- leave here quietly before the guard returns!
