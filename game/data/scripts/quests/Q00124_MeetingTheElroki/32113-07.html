You! Haven't you already left for the Primeval Isle? You haven't been at the wharf, have you? I don't know why you've come back here, but please -- go now! My friend, Mushika, is dying; any delay might be fatal to him.<br>
I have been visiting the wharf every day in the hope that news will come from the island that he has been cured. Don't disappoint me!
