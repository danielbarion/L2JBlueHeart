I'm afraid Giran may be too much for you right now. I can't send you there from here.<br>
If you insist on going there, take this <font color="LEVEL">Traveler's Mark</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape to the Town of Giran</font>.<br>
The magic scroll allows you to instantaneously travel to Giran, but remember, it only works once. Use it wisely. When you're ready to return, take the Traveler's Mark to <font color="LEVEL">Galladucci at his boutique</font>. He'll help you.<br>
Among all the Human cities, Giran is, by far, the loudest and most violent. Watch your back and have a safe trip!
