I may be a merchant now, but I used to be a <font color="LEVEL">Leather Cutter.</font> I used to work for Duke Van Dyke in my early days. During the Elmore War, I made hundreds of leather armors for the Duke's soldiers in ten days. Even after retiring, I still practice making leather armor from time to time to keep my skills sharp.<br>
A few days ago, Consul Sir Windawood came to see me himself and asked me to make fifty leather armors for the newly established militia. I can make that many on my own, but I don't have enough materials. I need quite a few more <font color="LEVEL">wolf pelts.</font> Can I ask you to find them for me?<br>
