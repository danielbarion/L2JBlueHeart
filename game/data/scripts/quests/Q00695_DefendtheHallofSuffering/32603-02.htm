I will tell you about the area you will enter and what you must do there.<br>
You will enter Hall of Suffering, which contains a <font color="LEVEL">Destroyed Tumor</font> in each room. The nearby <font color="LEVEL">Souls of Coffin</font> will gradually mutate into a <font color="LEVEL">Tumor of Death</font>. If that happens, it will supply nutrients to the Seed -- obviously, we must stop it.<br>
The undead in the area will try to prevent you from doing so. Ensure that all the Tumors remain in a <font color="LEVEL">deactivated state</font>.<br>
Finally, Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus, the chief gatekeepers of this area, will attack. If you can defeat them, your mission will have been a success.
