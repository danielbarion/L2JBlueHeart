Very well! The item that I require is an ultimate, rare herb that can be collected only once a year! But there is also an easy way to obtain it. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Cemetary</font> located to the east of the Town of Aden, and defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Taik Orc Supply Leaders</font> there. If you search their bodies afterward, you should be able to obtain it! I need five in order to save the Dreaming Girl of Flames.<br>
Go, and may the star of fate be upon you!
