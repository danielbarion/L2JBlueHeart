<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Romp:<br>
I placed numbers ranging from 1-9 on a numberpad. Of course I won't show you what they are!<br>
But I will take 100 Infernium Ores in advance. If you quit midgame, I won't give them back! Understand?<br>
Now it's time for you to pick 6 numbers ranging from 1-9. Pick your first number. <br>
