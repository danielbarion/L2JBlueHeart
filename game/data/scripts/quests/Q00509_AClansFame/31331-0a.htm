Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
Our townsfolk live in mortal fear of the Raid Bosses in this area. It would be disastrous if they were to actually intrude into the village...<br>
Our only hope is to obtain the assistance of a very powerful Clan Leader! Do you know one?<br>
(This quest is only available to the Leaders of Clans of level 6 and above.)
