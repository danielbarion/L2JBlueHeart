You are vigorous but with a cautious manner of walking, like that of a tiger with the eyes of a hawk! I can tell you are an adventurer of considerable skill! Yes, someone like you would be of much help to me. Please take pity on a poor man. A single half-wit is standing between me and my most beloved. If you will obtain a certain small object and bring it to me, I will pay you a generous reward.<br>
