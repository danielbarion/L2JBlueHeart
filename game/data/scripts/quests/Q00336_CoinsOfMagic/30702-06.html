To be honest... I investigated a little bit after you left. With the help of the guild, I uncovered out a region that has a lot of coins.<br>Let me see.... From what I've heard, <font color="LEVEL">Lakin</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Vanor Silenos</font> in southern Aden, and <font color="LEVEL">Timak Orcs</font> in northern Oren have coins.<br>
Also, I don't know specifically which ones, but I heard coins can be discovered in the <font color="LEVEL">Bandit Stronghold of Oren, Cemetery of Aden, Watcher's Tomb, Earth of Slaughter, Garden of Beasts, Valley of Saints, and the Ancient Battleground</font> regions.
