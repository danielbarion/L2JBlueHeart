Do you know what a numismatist is, pal? Some old fella came by a couple of days ago and called me one, and just as I was gearing up to knock him flat on his back, he says it was a term used for someone who collected coins. Looked it up, and he was only right, wasn't he? Stan the Numismatist... not easy to say after you've had a couple.<br>
So you looking to trade? I'm only after <font color="LEVEL">low grade coins</font> at the moment. Oh and here's what I can sell you:<br>
