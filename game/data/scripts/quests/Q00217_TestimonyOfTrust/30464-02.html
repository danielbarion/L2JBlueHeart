You must collect all three of the ingredients I described to you. Should I tell you one more time? Your race is so impatient that you forget the details!<br>
First, go to Death Pass and collect the blood of a <font color="LEVEL">Guardian Basilisk</font>. If you have 5 bottles of its blood, it can be refined into <font color="LEVEL">Basilisk Plasma</font>. Then go to the Wasteland and kill enough<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Ant Soldiers</font> to collect 5 Aphids. With them you will be able to obtain <font color="LEVEL">Honey Dew</font>.<br>
Lastly, go to the Cruma Marshlands and capture <font color="LEVEL">Marsh Stakatos</font> in order to collect 5 bottles of their fluids. They in turn can be rendered into <font color="LEVEL">Stakato Ichor</font>.
