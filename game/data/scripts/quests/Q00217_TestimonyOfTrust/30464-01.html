I don't understand why the Tetrarch would ask an outsider like you to do a job such as this. But I do not doubt the wisdom of Thifiell, and I have always observed the commandments of our race. So despite my reluctance, I will help you. I will tell you what ingredients you must collect.<br>
First, go to Death Pass and collect the blood of a <font color="LEVEL">Guardian Basilisk</font>. If you have 5 bottles of its blood, it can be refined into <font color="LEVEL">Basilisk Plasma</font>. Then go to the Wasteland and kill enough<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Ant Soldiers</font> to collect 5 Aphids. With them you will be able to obtain <font color="LEVEL">Honey Dew</font>.<br>
Lastly, go to the Cruma Marshlands and capture <font color="LEVEL">Marsh Stakatos</font> in order to collect 5 bottles of their fluids. They in turn can be rendered into <font color="LEVEL">Stakato Ichor</font>. Bring all three substances to me.
