<html><body> High Priest Hollint:<br>
Greetings!<br>
It is not easy to restore trust once it has been broken, but now thanks to your hard work, an opportunity has arisen. Based on your results, it seems that the impending <font color="LEVEL">chaotic chronicles</font> were instigated by the followers of Shilen - finally we have a name, a perpetrator that we can bring to justice!<br>
Now, the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Trust</font> is currently in the care of <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Biotin</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island</font>. He wants to meet you, so hand him this letter and he'll have a great deal to say to you!
