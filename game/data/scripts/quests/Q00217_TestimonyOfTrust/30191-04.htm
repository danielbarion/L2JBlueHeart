<html><body> High Priest Hollint:<br>
We shall see, my child! Your hubris may be a pitfall though, I'll warn you of that now.<br>
Now... listen carefully to my words. A great danger looms in our future; magisters have deciphered ill omens from the stars and the whispered messages of the elementals, while a bubbling tension between extremists from all six races has made war inevitable.<br>
If we are to survive the upcoming <font color="LEVEL">chaotic chronicles</font>, we must earn the trust of other races and combine our forces to stem the disaster. To that end, we have decided to send an envoy to leaders of each race in order to regain their trust. This is the <font color="LEVEL">Testimony of Trust</font> that we must now ask you to fulfill. You must represent our race as envoy to the leaders of all the other races and earn their trust so as to ensure that Aden is not pushed towards apocalypse.<br>
First, take these letters to the leaders of the Elf and Dark Elf races. Your first meeting should be with <font color="LEVEL">Elven Hierarch Asterios</font>.
