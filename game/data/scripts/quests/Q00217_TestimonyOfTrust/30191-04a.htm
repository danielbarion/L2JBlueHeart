<html><body> High Priest Hollint:<br>
We shall see, my child! Your hubris may be a pitfall though, I'll warn you of that now.<br>
Now... listen carefully to my words. A great danger looms in our future; it has become apparent that some malicious entity is trying to ferment discontent among the tribes, to stir their already rising tempers and thrust them into war with each other. The high priests and grand magisters recently convened on the matter, and all realize that such a war will scar our lands for generations to come. In short, we must act.<br>
Our only hope at this late stage is to gain the trust of the other races and combine our strengths to survive the <font color="LEVEL">Time of Chaos</font> that looms before us. However, the trust between the races is already wearing thin, so we have decided to dispatch a delegate who will take a message from the Humans to the leaders of each race. This task now falls to you, my child: we are entrusting this <font color="LEVEL">Testimony of Trust</font> to you.<br>
As our representative, you must meet with the leader of each race, convey our message, and receive their guarantee of peace.<br>
Take these two pages and meet the leaders of both the Elves and Dark Elves; start by visiting <font color="LEVEL">Elven Magister Asterios</font>.<br>
Oh, you should also take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it with the village gatekeeper for something special that will help you on your journey.
