<html><body>Warrior's Grave:<br>
There is no time to give you all the details now -- they can wait until the first step is finished.<br>
First, you must retrieve my ashes from this grave. A memorial ceremony will prepare my remains; sing the <font color="LEVEL">Warrior Song</font> that inspired countless Elrokian warriors as they prepared for battle in the days of old. Summoned by that old tune, my bones will rouse themselves from their long slumber and emerge.<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest Q00126_TheNameOfEvil2 32122-4b.html">"I think I'm ready to conduct the ceremony."</a>
