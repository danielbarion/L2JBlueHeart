These few moments may determine the fate of the Elroki tribe itself. Every second is precious!<br>
Had I more time, I would tell you of the hardships and trials facing us right now. I might even enlist your help! But sadly I cannot spare even the time for that. Farewell! (This quest can only be taken on by characters above level 77 who have completed the "Name of Evil 1" quest.)
