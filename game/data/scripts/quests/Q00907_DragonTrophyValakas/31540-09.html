<html><body>Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
What's that you say? You managed to kill the fire dragon? Well, yes, I heard but I thought they were talking about some other adventurer who managed to kill Valakas.<br>
You must feel like Emperor Shunaiman on Aden Mountain so who would want to mess with you.<br>
Well allow me to be the one to kick you off your pedestal so you can fall back to the real world. Valakas ain't dead. Never really dies. He comes back, ever now and then... grumpy as ever and we can expect someone like you to come knocking on his door asking him to turn down that noise.<br>
Well buck up kid, take these Medals of Glory... better than a lousy t-shirt.
