Yeah. How did you... never mind. Best of luck kid, you're gonna need it.<br>
You know I feel really dumb for saying this and stop me if you have heard it before... cause you know I've sent how many people to their countless deaths trying to kill that thing that everyone starts to look the same, but you shouldn't go after Valakas solo.<br>
Your best bet would be <font color="LEVEL">attacking Valakas with a large group of equally skilled adventurers.</font>
