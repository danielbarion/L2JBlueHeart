Is it hot in here or is it just me? Ha, that one never gets old... well, maybe a little. As you probably know this path leads to the lair of Valakas.<br>
Oh how many have come and became one with the flame that fills these halls...<br>
Valakas calls and those brave souls answer. Not like you though. Destiny has brought you here to face and defeat Valakas.<br>
Do you want to fight the beast? Do ya? Who wants to fight Valakas?<br>
