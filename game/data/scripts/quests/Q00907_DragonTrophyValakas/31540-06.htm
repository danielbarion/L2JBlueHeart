Nothing special... just march through the vast army of creatures created by the Fire Dragon Valakas into his lair and vanquish the most feared and deadly creature known to roam this land which will most likely kill you and all those around you.<br>
Nah, nothing too much. Just come back with proof you have defeated Valakas and I'll have a surprise waiting for you.<br>
You'll never guess what it is.<br>
