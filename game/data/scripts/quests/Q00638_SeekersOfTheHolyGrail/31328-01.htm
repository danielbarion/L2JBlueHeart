Recent activities at the <font color="LEVEL">Pagan Temple</font> have raised my concerns. Considering the shenanigans that normally go on there, you must surely understand the peril!<br>
You see, they've set their sights on Saint Solina's <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Splendor</font>! I'm sure that if we don't stop them, something terrible and irrevocable will happen! Will you help us in our time of need?<br>
