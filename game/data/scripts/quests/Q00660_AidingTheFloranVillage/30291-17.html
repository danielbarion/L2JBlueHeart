I can't thank you enough, soldier. You've helped our poor little farming community beyond measure. Maria thanks you, too. Here's all I have to offer you for your help — aside from our appreciation, which for soldiers like us is the highest reward. It's a small gift, but please accept it. Maybe it'll help you somehow, in some way.<br>
