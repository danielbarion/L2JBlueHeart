Well, if that's what you want, I won't stop you. Obviously there's no shortage of adventure out there. But don't forget us in Floran Village, should you find yourself at loose ends. We're not the plaything of some idle lord; we're an independent farmers' commune, and we welcome the help of a competent band of adventurers. Good luck in your travels.
