I've heard that you work for the Golden Wheel Guild ... Is this true?<br>
Young friend, let me give you a piece of advice. Spiron is only taking advantage of you. That mean old man is only interested in generating profits for his guild!<br>
If you should ever get hurt or run into trouble while carrying out guild business, don't expect Spiron to help you. He'll only argue that your demise wasn't in the original deal or contract.
