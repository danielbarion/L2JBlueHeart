<html><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br>
As I previously stated, in order to pass the Trials of the Summoner, you must <font color="LEVEL">battle and defeat six summoners</font>. Before you challenge an opponent, you must have your own unique <font color="LEVEL">Arcana Cards</font> created. Go and ask <font color="LEVEL">Lara of the town of Dion</font> about making cards.<br>
Do you have any other questions?<br>
