Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Go defeat <font color="LEVEL">Rahha</font> and bring me Rahha's Fang.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I have said, you don't have to kill Rahha yourself.</font> There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! <font color="LEVEL">Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Rahha and then bring back Rahha's Fang.</font>
