Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Very well! Slay <font color="LEVEL">Palibati Queen Themis</font> and bring me her scale.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Remember, you don't have to kill Palibati Queen Themis yourself.</font> There's no rule that says a Clan Leader must get his hands bloody! <font color="LEVEL">Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Palibati Queen Themis and then bring me back her scale.</font><br>
