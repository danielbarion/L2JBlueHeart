Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Then kill <font color="LEVEL">Shillien Priest Hisilrome</font> and bring me his heart.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I mentioned before, you don't have to kill Hisilrome yourself.</font> There is no rule that says the clan leader has to use his sword personally. <font color="LEVEL">If your clan members defeat Hisilrome, simply bring back proof of the victory.</font>
