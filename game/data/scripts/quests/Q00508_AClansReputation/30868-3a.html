Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Fine! Then go and kill <font color="LEVEL">Gargoyle Lord Tiphon</font> and bring me the Tiphon Shard.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Just so we're clear, I'll tell you this once more. You don't have to kill Gargoyle Lord Tiphon yourself.</font> There's no rule that says a Clan Leader must get his hands bloody! <font color="LEVEL">Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Gargoyle Lord Tiphon and then bring back the Tiphon Shard to me.</font><br>
