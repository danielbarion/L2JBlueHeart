Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Very well, go and kill <font color="LEVEL">Last Lesser Giant Glaki</font> and bring me Glaki's Nucleus.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I have said, you don't have to kill Last Lesser Giant Glaki yourself.</font> There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! <font color="LEVEL">Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Last Lesser Giant Glaki and then bring me back Glaki's Nucleus.</font>
