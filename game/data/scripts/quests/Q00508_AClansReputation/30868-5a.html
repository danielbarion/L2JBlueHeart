Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Very well, go and kill <font color="LEVEL">Rahha</font> and bring me Rahha's Fang.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Just so we're clear, I'll tell you this once more. You don't have to kill Rahha yourself.</font> There's no rule that says a Clan Leader must get his hands bloody! <font color="LEVEL">Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Rahha and then bring me back Rahha's Fang.</font><br>
