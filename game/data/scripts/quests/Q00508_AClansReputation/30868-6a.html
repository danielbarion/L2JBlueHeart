Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Very well, go and kill the <font color="LEVEL">Flamestone Giant</font> and bring me the Nucleus of Flamestone Giant.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Remember, you don't have to kill Flamestone Giant yourself.</font> There's no rule that says a Clan Leader must get his hands bloody! <font color="LEVEL">Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Flamestone Giant and then bring me back the Nucleus of Flamestone Giant.</font><br>
