Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Very well, go and kill the <font color="LEVEL">Last Lesser Giant Glaki</font> and bring me Glaki's Nucleus.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Remember, you don't have to kill the Last Lesser Giant Glaki yourself.</font> There's no rule that says a Clan Leader must get his hands bloody! <font color="LEVEL">Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Last Lesser Giant Glaki and then bring me back Glaki's Nucleus.</font><br>
