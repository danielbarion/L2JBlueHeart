Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Fine! Then go and kill <font color="LEVEL">Gargoyle Lord Tiphon</font> and bring me the Tiphon Shard.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I have said, you don't have to kill Gargoyle Lord Tiphon yourself.</font> There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! <font color="LEVEL">Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Gargoyle Lord Tiphon and then bring me its Tiphon Shard.</font>
