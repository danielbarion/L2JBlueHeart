<html><body>Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>
Soon we will hold the <font color="LEVEL">Ceremony of Darkness</font>, our most sacred ritual, in honor of Gran Kain and Shilen. The Human Mystics of the Ivory Tower who witnessed it last year were awed at its magnificence, so we must make it even grander this year! But there is still much to prepare, and several of our under-clerics were recently eaten by Giant Spiders.<br>
We require certain items from the village, and I cannot spare anyone to retrieve them. Will you serve your goddess by assisting me?<br>
