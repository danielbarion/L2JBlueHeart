Yes, that's it. The Energy Ore!<br>
If this works, I will be able to transform this common substance into a perfect instant energy crystal. Thank you for your help.<br>
If you have time, would you collect some more materials? The energy converter device's success rate is still low, so I need as much Energy Ore as I can get for more tests. What do you say? Will you help me again?<br>
