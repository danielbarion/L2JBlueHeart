It has also been a long time since I last spoke with him.<br>
But he gave me courage and a mission at a point in my life where I had given up my research and was deeply depressed.<br>
Thanks to him, I was able to resume the research that I had abandoned, and I was able to discover a way to escape from the wheel of fate that had been destined by the gods.<br>
At that time, he told me to tell this information to someone of a different faith who came in search of it.<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">You who have escaped the wheel of the gods -- only you can escape from the lash of fate.</font></center><br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">The oldest one among you will know the way.</font></center>Those were his words.<br>
This is all I can tell you. I am sorry I can be of no other help.<br>
