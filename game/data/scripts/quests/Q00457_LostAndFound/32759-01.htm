<html><body>Treasure Hunter Gumiel:<br>
Ah, so my eyes do not deceive me! You are real, aren't you? And you don't look like one of those bloody monks, thank goodness. I've got a story to tell, if you'd listen. Thing is... I'm in disguise. I snuck into this Monastery because I heard there was a great treasure here but I'm so lost I was starting to fear I'd end up hunkered down in a corner and eventually end up a bag of bones for all time.<br>
You look like you still have your wits about you, you might be able to help me out. Could you show me the way? Please?!<br>
