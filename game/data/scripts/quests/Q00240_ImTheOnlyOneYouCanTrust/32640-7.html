<html><body>Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:<br>
As you can see, I'm a bounty hunter. And generally, I do what I do for the money. But this one is personal to me.<br>
I'm here to bring in Billy Haari for his crimes.<br>And I almost had him... until he ran into the Stakato's Nest. I'm good at what I do. But this place is a bit too much for even me.<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest Q00240_ImTheOnlyOneYouCanTrust 32640-2.htm">"Well, good luck with that. Now what about that mission?"</a>
