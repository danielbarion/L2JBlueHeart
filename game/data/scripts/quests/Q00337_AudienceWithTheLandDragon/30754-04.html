<html><body>Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
I can feel a strong dark energy in the valley... If you don't hurry and destroy the <font color="LEVEL">Abyss Jewel,</font> Antharas will awaken even before you step into the dragon's nest. Hurry. Kill the <font color="LEVEL">Cave Keepers and Cave Maidens,</font> then destroy the jewel! Take the jewel shards and go find <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchman Theodric.</font> He guards the entrance to Antharas' nest in the deepest part of the dragon's valley.
