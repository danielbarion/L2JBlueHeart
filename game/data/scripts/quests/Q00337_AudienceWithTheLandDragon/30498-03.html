Ah, a fragment of the Abyssal Jewel and a fang of the jewel guardian! Great job. I will send this fragment to Filaur of the Gray Pillar so that he can destroy it in the "blast furnace of supremacy". This will prevent the seal that restrains Antharas from ever being threatened again. Thanks to you the seal is now safe. Take this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Watchman</font>. You have proven yourself worthy of receiving it.
