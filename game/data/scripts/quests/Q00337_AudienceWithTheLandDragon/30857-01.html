That is a Feather of Gabrielle... So you must be one of those who want to go on the Antharas expedition, and need a Mark of Watchman from me. I wonder why we have to keep driving innocent young men into that evil cave... Meaningless, so meaningless...<br>
These endless deaths, the vicious cycle of destruction. Long have I mourned the cruelty of fate. Then, one day, I realized a solution exists. Misery begins because of our misdeeds. The gods sent demons to this earth in order to punish their creations who commit violent and repulsive acts.<br>
Do you know? Do you know what sin our ancestors committed to appease the dragons? Before putting up a barrier to bind Antharas, they sacrificed innocent virgins to the dragon every year. But, as if the gods were mocking our evil subservient act, the sacrificed girls were reborn as demons called Bloody Queens. To this day, those pitiful, wretched creatures have been cursing the humans who sacrificed them as offerings.<br>
If you wish to meet Antharas, we must first wash away the selfish sins of our past. If you head north from this village, you will find an area called the Forbidden Gateway. Bring down the <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Queen</font> that appears there. Then, the <font color="LEVEL">Spirits of the Sacrificed</font> will appear. Grant them rest in death and bring back their <font color="LEVEL">Remains of the Sacrificed.</font> With that we can give them a death service and allow their souls to rest forever.
