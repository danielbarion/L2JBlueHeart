Are you still here? Please hury and bring back the poison sac. My students are dying, and watching those youngsters muttering in their delirium just breaks my heart.<br>
Go to the northern part of Talking Island, kill the <font color="LEVEL">Giant Spider,</font> and bring back its poison sac. If you bring the poison sac to Priest Yohanes, he will make the medicine for the fever, so bring that to me. Please make haste!
