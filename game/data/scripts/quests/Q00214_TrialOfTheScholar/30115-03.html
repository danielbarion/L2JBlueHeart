Good. Take this mark for now. I will tell you about the monsters that you must investigate. First, we have the <font color="LEVEL">Monster Eye Destroyers</font>. There are many of them in the Wasteland and the Plains of Dion. Please bring back 5 of their hides.<br>
Second, we have the <font color="LEVEL">Breka Orc Shamans</font>. You will find them easily in Giran. Defeat them and bring back 5 Shaman Necklaces.<br>
Finally, you must confront the monsters called <font color="LEVEL">Shackle</font>. We need 2 scalps from them. They appear at the Watcher's Tomb, but one word of caution: Recently, they have also appeared at the Ivory Tower Crater. Either way, if you aren't careful, you will lose your life. So remain vigilant. All this may be difficult to remember, so I will make a list for you.
