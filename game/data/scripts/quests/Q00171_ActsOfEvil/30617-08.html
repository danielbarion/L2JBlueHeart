This is just the beginning of the carnage! The Ol Mahums will rue the day they deceived us! We will attack their barracks at dawn and give no quarter!<br>
Go to Gludin and tell them that they are off the hook... For now. One day the mighty Turek tribe will sweep down like a black cloud and destroy them!
