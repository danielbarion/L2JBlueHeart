Why are you still here? Have you already forgotten our plan? Take the weapons to <font color="LEVEL">the Orc Barracks</font>. Tell <font color="LEVEL">Turek Chief Burai</font> of the Ol Mahums' treachery. The orcs will take care of them.<br>
Keep the mark of the Silver Scale guild with you always! When you show it to them, they will know that I sent you. Now be on your way!
