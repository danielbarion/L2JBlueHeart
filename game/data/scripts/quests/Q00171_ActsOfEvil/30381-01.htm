<html><body>Guard Alvah:<br>
We have had many problems lately from the Turek orcs. The worst has been their looting and pillaging! Recently a wagon crossing the Dark Elven Forest was attacked and all the cargo stolen. The Aden Trade Union has filed a formal request for assistance from the Gludio Guards!<br>
Unfortunately, since the Ol Mahums are constantly trying to sneak into Gludin Village, the guards cannot leave their posts even for a moment! There has been much discussion on this subject, and we have come to the conclusion that our only option at this point is to hire mercenaries to drive out the Turek orcs.<br>
