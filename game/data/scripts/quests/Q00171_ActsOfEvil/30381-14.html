What did Neti say? <font color="LEVEL">Trader Rolento</font>? That Dwarf with the business near the <font color="LEVEL">southern entrance of the Wasteland</font> drafted the Weapons Trade Contract?<br>
I knew that guy wasn't on the level... Such an odd place for a business... He must have done that to avoid notice of his nefarious dealings...<br>
You must confront Trader Rolento with this Contract. If he confesses to dealing with the Ol Mahums I will have him arrested!
