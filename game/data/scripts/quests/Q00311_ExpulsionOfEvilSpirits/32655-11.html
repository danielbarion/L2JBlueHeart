You have brought back 10 Soul Cores! If I combine the power of these cores with this pendant... like... so. This is the <font color="LEVEL">Guardian Spirit's Pendant</font>! This item is absolutely necessary to stand against <font color="LEVEL">Varangka</font>, the chief of the Ragna Orcs. Without this item, you will not be able to endure his evil powers.<br>
Go west to Kasha's Altar and defeat him, and the power of the evil spirits in this place will be greatly decreased.<br>
