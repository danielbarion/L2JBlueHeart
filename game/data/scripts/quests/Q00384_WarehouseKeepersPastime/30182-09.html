I'll place numbers 1-9 on a 3x3 numberpad. Then you pick 6 numbers out of 1-9. When you finished your choices, we count how many lines can be made from your numbers: horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Got it? Maybe the easiest way to learn is to play it once. <br>
I'll give you a reward if your choice of numbers can make 3 lines.<br>
