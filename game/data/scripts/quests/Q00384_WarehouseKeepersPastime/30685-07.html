Did you bring the medals? Alright, then, let's play Bingo! <br>
Our Bingo rules state that you can bet only 10 or 100 medals. Of course, when you bet 100 medals you stand a better chance of winning a high-quality item. <br>
<font color="LEVEL">By the way, before you start playing Bingo, make sure you have enough room in your inventory! It would be a shame if you didn't have room for all your winnings, don't you think? </font><br>
