<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Cliff:<br>
Good! Bring back my <font color="LEVEL">Medals of the Warehouse Keeper</font> and I'll give you a <font color="LEVEL">chance to play bingo</font> with the big boys. If you do well, you can get an abandoned item from my warehouse as a reward. Who knows? You might get a nice weapon or a new set of armor. Ha ha!<br>
According to rules of the game, you can <font color="LEVEL">bet either 10 or 100 medals.</font> So to begin, you'll need to recover at least 10 medals. Of course, betting 100 gives you a better chance of winning. <br>
Oh! Just so you know, <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Baxt in Hunter's Village</font> plays with me, and he offered to help recover the stolen medals.<br>
Now, from what the eyewitnesses told us, the monsters who attacked the wagon were <font color="LEVEL">Sunken Golems, Giant Eyes, Conjurers, Lord Conjurers, Tulbens, Hunter Gargoyles, Dust Winds, Thunder Wyrms, Karincains, Weird Drakes, Grave Guards, Conductors of Nightmare, Watchers of Nightmare and Rulers of Nightmare</font>. Good luck!
