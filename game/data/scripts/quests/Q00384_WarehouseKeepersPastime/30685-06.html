As Cliff mentioned before, defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Rotting Golem, Giant Monstereye, Conjurer Bat, Conjurer Bat Lord, Tulben, Hunter Gargoyle, Dragon Bearer Chief, Dragon Bearer Warrior, Dragon Bearer Archer, Dustwind Gargoyle, Thunder Wyrm, Karicain, Weird Drake, Grave Guard, Nightmare Guide, Nightmare Keeper, and Nightmare Lord</font>, and collect the <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper's Medals</font> that were stolen by them. Then I will give you <font color="LEVEL">a chance to play Bingo</font>! The cargo wagon security was not great, obviously, so I'm taking responsibility and will help retrieve it. <br>
If you do well at bingo, I'll give you an abandoned item in my warehouse for a reward. You might get a nice weapon or a decent piece armor if you're lucky. Ha ha ha....<br>
According to the commonly used bingo rules between warehouse keepers, <font color="LEVEL">the number of medals to bet are either 10 or 100.</font> You will need to gather at least 10 medals. Of course, betting 100 will give you higher chance of winning the better item....<br>
