<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Cliff:<br>
Recently, a <font color="LEVEL">cargo wagon from Hunter's Village was attacked by monsters</font>, and all its freight was stolen. Most of the items weren't very valuable, but a  <font color="LEVEL">large quantity of Medals of the Warehouse Keeper was also being transported.</font> Every one was taken!<br>
Why were all those medals on that cargo wagon, you ask? Well, the thing is...I went to the warehouse in Hunter's Village on my recent day off, and I won big. In fact, I won too many medals to carry back. So I arranged to send them with next cargo wagon...<br>
Will you help get them back for me?<br>
