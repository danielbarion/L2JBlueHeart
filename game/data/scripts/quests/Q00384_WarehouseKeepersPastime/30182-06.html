As I mentioned before, defeat <font color="LEVEL">Rotting Golem, Giant Monstereye, Conjurer Bat, Conjurer Bat Lord, Tulben, Hunter Gargoyle, Dustwind Gargoyle, Thunder Wyrm, Karicain, Weird Drake, Grave Guard, Nightmare Guide, Nightmare Keeper, Nightmare Lord</font>, etc. and collect the <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper's Medals</font> that they stole. Do that, and you may have the privilege of <font color="LEVEL">PLAYING BINGO</font>! If you then somehow prove your bingo worth, I'll give you an abandoned item in my warehouse. What could be more exciting than that? I've had years to collect things. Ha ha ha~<br>
Now, we play by the bingo rules firmly established three hundred and twelve years, sixty three days ago. That means, <font color="LEVEL">the number of medals to bet are either 10 or 100.</font> So you need a minimum of 10 medals. I'm sure you'll get at least.. twice that. Maybe more. And the more you bet, the more chances you have to win better items. <br>
And THAT'S NOT ALL!! You can also visit <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Baxt in Hunter's Village</font> to play Bingo. He is somewhat responsible for the cargo wagon assault and has agreed to cooperate.<br>
