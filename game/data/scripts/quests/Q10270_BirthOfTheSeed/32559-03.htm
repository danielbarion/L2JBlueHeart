<body>War Mage Artius:<br>
Ah! You came because of the favor I asked of Plenos. There's an important mission I have in mind, but I must stay here to safeguard the <font color="LEVEL">Barrier Orb</font>. That's why I asked him to gather some capable adventurers.<br>
We must gather information about the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity</font>. You know that the major areas of the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity</font> are guarded by the undead, don't you? I hear that each of these areas is guarded by an especially strong chief gatekeeper.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The Hall of Suffering is guarded by the twin Death Knights Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus, and the Hall of Erosion is guarded by Cohemenes.</font>You must defeat these chief gatekeepers and bring proof. Through that we might be able to learn some vital intelligence.
