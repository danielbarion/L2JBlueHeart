Ohh! You have obtained a complete Map! Well done! We can finally find out the location of the hidden chrysolite vein! I will reward you as promised. This should be enough.<br>
Let me see ... Hmm ... Oh. Stupid Orcs, their Map is too hard to read. But I can still roughly figure out the location. My investigators will have no problem locating the vein.<br>
As I said before, there are many hidden veins. Continue to find more Maps! I will reward you whenever you bring new Maps, so don't worry about that.<br>
