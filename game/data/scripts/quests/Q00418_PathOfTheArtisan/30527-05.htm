Oh, fine, fine!  I see that you are ready for the Artisan test.<br>
It is administered by the guild master of the Black Anvil, of whom you have certainly heard - a blacksmith of great renown!  I will give the first, most basic of the tests; if you pass, you may go on to the second test.<br>
Shall we begin?<br>
