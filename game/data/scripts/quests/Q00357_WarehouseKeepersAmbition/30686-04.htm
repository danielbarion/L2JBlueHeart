<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Silva:<br>
What kind of business? Eh... Well, I suppose there's no reason why I shouldn't talk to you about this.<br>
The warehouse chief over there has announced that he plans to retire next year. Either old man Sorint or I will succeed him -- he will choose the one who makes the most profit running a side business between now and next year.<br>
My chance has come at last! I'm tired of toiling away here when I should be in charge, and I'll be darned if I'm passed over for that incompetent fool Sorint.<br>
