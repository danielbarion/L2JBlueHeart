Oh! Yes, I got a little too excited there!<br>
Ah... Mr. Sorint, I was just speaking with this customer. Nothing to worry about, sir!<br>
Oh! What a stupid old man... Anyway, what I need from you is very simple: <font color="LEVEL">Jade</font>. It's become very popular for jewelry among Aden noblewomen these days! I will reward you for any Jades you bring me. <font color="LEVEL">Bring more than 100 at once and I'll give you an additional bonus.</font> How about it? Simple, eh?<br>
To find Jades, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Valley</font> and hunt <font color="LEVEL">Forest Runners, Fline Elders, Liele Elders, and Valley Treant Elders</font>. Got it?<br>
That's a dangerous place these days, so you should probably <font color="LEVEL">recruit a few trusted friends to help. Not too many! But don't try to go alone, OK?</font>
