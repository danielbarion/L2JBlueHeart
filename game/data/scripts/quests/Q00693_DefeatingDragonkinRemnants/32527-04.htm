There have been cases in which the defeated party kept requesting a rematch, <font color="LEVEL">so by rule the battle is allowed only once a day. (The clock is reset in real time at 6:30 AM)</font> You can come back to avenge your defeat any time the next day if you want.<br>
This battle is only available when the Seed of Destruction is stable. Otherwise, we are the ones who must flee from the Dragon Tribe! Who knows, perhaps we might end up serving as their entertainment instead!<br>
Any questions? It will seem simpler once you're in battle -- I promise. What do you say? Ready to do it?<br>
