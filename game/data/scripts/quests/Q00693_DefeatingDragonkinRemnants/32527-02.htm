The rules are so simple, I almost don't need to explain. <font color="LEVEL">When your party is ready, the remnants will be freed at the Entrance of Destruction. You and your party will enter through it. Then we will block the only passage.</font>At that point, the full-scale show-down begins.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">You and your party will eliminate the remnants and escape after breaking through the blocked passage.</font> You'll be rewarded for your efforts, I promise you.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">However, you have only 20 minutes to succeed.</font> I'm not releasing those hard-caught remnants simply to watch a long and boring battle! You will lose if everyone in your team dies or if more than 1 minute passes after everyone escapes through Scroll of Escape or some other means. If I have to send my troops to catch them again, I won't pay you a thing.<br>
