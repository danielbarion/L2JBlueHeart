<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
This is a fragment of Maphr's Tablet! Amazing! I certainly chose the right person for this mission. Well done! The elders will be very pleased. I should tell you that it is rumored that another fragment of the tablet was recently found as well. With two of them, our studies can rapidly move forward!<br>
Now we must send this fragment to the Dwarven Village. Only the elders are able to decipher the Giants' language inscribed on it.<br>
Now that you've passed the second test, I can give you the  <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Prosperity</font> as a reward. At this rate, you'll soon be a high-ranking guild member! May Maphr's abundance be yours and your children's children!
