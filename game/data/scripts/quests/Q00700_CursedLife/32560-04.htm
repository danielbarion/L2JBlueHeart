<html><body>Soldier Orbyu:<br>
The bigger problem is <font color="LEVEL">Rok</font>, who became undead because of the evil power of the Seed of Infinity. The Rok and its followers, <font color="LEVEL">Mutant Birds and Dra Hawks</font> are viciously attacking everyone in their sight.<br>
They have attacked and eaten people before, but not like this.<br>
The army has been ordered to destroy them. I'm in charge of recruiting the adventurers we need for the task.<br>
I guess it's better this way. Only by destroying their accursed lives can we truly liberate these once-noble creatures.<br>
Will you help us?<br>
