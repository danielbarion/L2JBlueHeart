Respected friend of the Varka. I no longer have any duties to give you. There is no one among us who is as courageous and faithful as you. The Varka Silenos of the village will give you their greatest service and benefit. Come to the Varka's village without hesitation.<br>
But if their treatment does not satisfy you, you may give up the alliance.<br>
