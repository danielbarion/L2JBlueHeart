<html><body>Grand Olympiad Manager:<br>
Please participate in all the various categories of matches in the Olympiad. If you participate in each of the <font color="LEVEL">non-class battles, class battles, and group battles 5 times</font>, your mission will be complete.<br>
If it is difficult to participate in the three match categories, you can participate in just one category, and you will still receive some reward. If you're still satisfied, you can come to me. But please remember that once you receive the reward, you can't take on the mission again that same day.<br>
