<html><body>Watcher of Antharas Theodric:<br>
Word has already spread throughout the land that you and your fellowship have defeated the land dragon Antharas. Enjoy your victory while it lasts. Unfortunately, the legends are true about Antharas... the beast can never truly be killed. It will rise once again.<br>
True to my code, I will stand watch for the land dragon's return. When it does I will be here awaiting your return.<br>
As promised, here is the gift of fame and fortune. These are rare... be sure to use them wisely.
