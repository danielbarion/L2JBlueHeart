You look like quite the seasoned veteran, know that? Bet you're bored of those old fields... maybe looking for more of a challenge, hmm?<br>
The Helvetica Research Project has had its eye on those grounds for quite some time now, only those monsters are stopping us from sending staff there to begin construction.
