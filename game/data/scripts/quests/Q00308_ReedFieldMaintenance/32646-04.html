Well, Phase 1 of the project is to rid the Fields of Silence and Whispering of the creatures there... they are pretty much halting development.<br>
You'll most likely face <font color="LEVEL">Mucrokian Fanatics, Mucrokian Ascetics, Mucrokian Saviors, Mucrokian Preachers and Contaminated Mucrokians</font>. Oh, and be on the look out for <font color="LEVEL">Awakened Mucrokians</font>. They're incredibly fierce and more than a little cranky after slumbering all these years. They'll probably be the biggest threat you'll face.<br>
Now here's how payment works:<br>
We have several packages based on the number of Mucrokian Hides you bring us. Each package will vary in cost for Mucrokian Hide. However, due to the difficulty in bringing down one of those Awakened Mucrokians, if you manage to bring us back those hides it will be worth double. So as an example, say you have 100 Awakened Mucrokian Hides, and say there is a package that requires 200 Mucrokian Hides. You can turn in those 100 Hides to claim that package.<br>
And that's it! Come see me when you are ready to cash in on your work.
