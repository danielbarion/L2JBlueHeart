Oh... You have completed Dr. Hell Doscozer's request! I'll give you a very fair price for the Mucrokian Skins. You only need to bring the right number of Mucrokian Skins or Awakened Mucrokian Skins.<br>
As I told you, I will pay you twice for the Mutated Mucrokian Skins, but also, when calculating for the Dynasty ingredient item, I will calculate the Awakened Mucrokian Skins first. Now, which will you receive?<br>
