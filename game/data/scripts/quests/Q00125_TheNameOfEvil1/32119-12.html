I have already discovered why you are here by connecting the threads of events past.<br>
You need not prove yourself to me.<br>
That I am awake and communicate with you now is the will of Shilen.<br>
O fated outsider, what ancient wisdom do you seek?<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest Q00125_TheNameOfEvil1 32119-14.html">"I heard that you know everything about what happened in the past. But why were you asleep?"</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest Q00125_TheNameOfEvil1 32119-16.html">"I would like to receive wisdom about the item Mushika gave me."</a>
