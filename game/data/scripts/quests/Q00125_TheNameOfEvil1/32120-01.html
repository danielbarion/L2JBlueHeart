The ancient stone pillar does not seem particularly unique, but you sense something secret and powerful in it. It almost seems to be waiting for something...or someone. Perhaps it is one of the pillars created by Shilen...<br>
Since you don't know how to communicate with the pillar, perhaps it would be better to return after learning how to do so.
