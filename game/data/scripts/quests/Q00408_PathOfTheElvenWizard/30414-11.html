If you devote four jewels, symbolizing water, fire, wind and earth, to Mother Nature and perform the ritual for Eva's blessing, in return, you will be able to communicate more deeply with the spirits.<br>
I already gave you the Fertility Peridot so go and find the remaining three by yourself. Which jewel do you want to seek first?<br>
