<html><body>Master Selsia:<br>
Eliminate the Crimson Lady and retrieve the Giants' Research Documents.<br>
We must not allow secrets concerning our race to fall into other hands.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Crimson Lady is being guarded by Timak Orcs and Timak Orc Archers at the Timak Outpost</font>.<br>
Slay the <font color="LEVEL">Timak Orcs and Timak Orc Archers</font> and you will no doubt find her.<br>
This is not an easy task, but I believe in you...<br>
Good luck to you!
