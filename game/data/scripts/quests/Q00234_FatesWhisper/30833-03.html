<html><body>Magister Kaspar:<br>
Have you met <font color="LEVEL">Magister Hanellin of the Town of Aden</font>? Baium will tell you how to access the sealed room on the top floor of the Tower of Insolence. Please don't forget that you promised to cut Baium with the <font color="LEVEL">pipet knife</font> I gave you, and absorb at least a few drops of his blood. This will turn the knife red. Bring it to me and I will give you Maestro Reorin's Mold.
