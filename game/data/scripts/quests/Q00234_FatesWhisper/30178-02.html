What can I do? I already sold it to someone else. Think about it! That mold was used by one of the 10 finest artisans in the kingdom. Wouldn't everyone want it? <br>
Hmm...I can take a look at my account book to see if I recorded who purchased it... Yes, here it is! A few months ago, <font color="LEVEL">Magister Kaspar</font> bought the mold. He resides at <font color="LEVEL">Hardin's Academy</font>. That's all you need, right?
