<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Cliff:<br>
Good news! The guild elders have issued Maestro Reorin a pardon! Hopefully now he can put all the unpleasantness behind him and get back to work at the blacksmith guild. What a shame that I am now a warehouse keeper and will not get the pleasure of working with him... Oh well, I'm glad to see good things finally happening for him again.
