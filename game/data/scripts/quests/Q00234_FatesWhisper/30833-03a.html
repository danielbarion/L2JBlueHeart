We seek <font color="LEVEL">Baium's Blood</font> here in the Tower of Insolence. Baium is the only descendant of Emperor Shunaiman, who received Einhasad's blessing, and the blood of the cursed royal family that was sealed by the angels flows in his body. That is what we need.<br>
Now, take this <font color="LEVEL">Pipette Knife.</font> If you inflict even one injury on Baium's body, it will absorb that blood and turn red. Then, bring it back to me.<br>
It will be difficult, of course, to even reach the place where Baium is sealed, but a way is known. Please go meet with <font color="LEVEL">Magister Hanellin in Aden Castle Town.</font>
