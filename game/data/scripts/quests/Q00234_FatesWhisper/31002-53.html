Young man, just wait for a bit while I work on it, and I'll make you a weapon that'll shock the world.  You can count on it!<br>
Clang! Clang! Hit it with Maphr's hammer! Just like tapping on her window! Clang! Clang!<br>
Clang! Clang! Heat it up with the flames of Pa'agrio! Just like whispering sweet nothings into her ear! Clang! Clang!<br>
Clang! Clang! Now immerse it into Eva's water! Just like wiping her tears! Clang! Clang!<br>
Clang! Clang! Cool it with Saiha's wind! Just like her laughter echoes in my ears! Clang! Clang!<br>
Clang! Clang! The passion of the flames is burning in that cold metal! Just as love  blooms in a maiden's heart! Clang! Clang!<br>
...There, finished! Hahaha! I really don't mean to brag, but there are only a few dwarves who can make A-grade weapons. And I, Maestro Reorin, am one of them.  Now I give you this <font color="LEVEL">Infernal Master</font>.<br>
You'll want this as well.  This is a proof of authenticity, certifying that the weapon was made based upon the theme of the two great constellations: the Phoenix of Revolution and the Dawn Messenger.  A woman who came to meet me a while ago asked me to draw this up for you and to give it to you along with the new weapon. <br> Well, then, it's time for us to say good-bye. Thank you so much; I enjoy exerting my abilities to their fullest, and the opportunities grow fewer every year. And if you chance to meet that woman again, please give her my regards.
