To make A-Grade A weapon for you, I must have my special hammer! It is currently in the possession of <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Ferris of the Town of Aden</font>. 
At one time he was my apprentice but when I had my problems with the guild he turned against me. I cannot bear to see him. Please go and get my hammer from him.
