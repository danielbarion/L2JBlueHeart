<html><body>Magister Nell:<br>
Well, if I only needed them for my research, these would be enough. But a Elder taught me all about these gemstones.<br>
He said that he needed them, and asked me to collect the fragments for him.<br>At that time the trader Katerina of Talking Island was there. She is also collecting gemstones.<br>
When she gives the gemstones to the Elder, I also want to give at least the same quantity to him. You see, I am a magister... I can't be outdone by a trader like Katerina. Do you understand?<br>
Please do this for me. Collect more gemstones so that I can give them to the Elder.<br>
