I am going to tell you this secret because I only found out about it thanks to your help. Apparently, there is a <font color="LEVEL">passage that leads directly to the second tower of the Steel Citadel</font>. I found it easily enough, and I think you will, too. In fact, if you want to use that passage, go speak with <font color="LEVEL">Deltuva</font>. Since you helped me by obtaining the blueprint, I know he will help you. May Maphr protect you!
