<html><body>Gantaki Zu Urutu:<br>
On behalf of the Urutu tribe, I present you with this gift for the Flame Lord: a rare <font color="LEVEL">Deep Sea Orb</font><br>
Fished from the depths of the Black Seas of the west, it is prized even by the Humans, who call it "pearl." Those who carry it on their person gain the ability to part the mists of time and see the future. May the great Kakai see in it only victory and glory!
