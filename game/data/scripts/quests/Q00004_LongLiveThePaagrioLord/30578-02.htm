Dekara Lamchar Kakai! Perhaps you've heard that Flame Lord Kakai has fallen ill. The Elders have decreed that each tribe should offer him <font color="LEVEL">something to help restore his health</font>. I was supposed to collect the items, but we have heard that there are troublemakers about and I am reluctant to leave my post. Will you meet the representatives of each tribe and bring back their gifts?<br>
