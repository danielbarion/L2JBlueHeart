<html><body>Guard Luis:<br>
Your face is unfamiliar. You must be a traveler.<br>
I trust you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory? It was enough to have Ol Mahum stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us... Now the lizardmen from the south!<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">highway of the southern shoreline</font> that leads to Giran has seen frequent attacks by <font color="LEVEL">Langk Lizardman</font>. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling to Gludin were attacked! We Gludio guards are already stretched thin. We need more experienced help.<br>
(Only a character of level 19 or above may undertake this quest.)
