Oh... So this the new calculator! Good work. I will reward you as promised. You don't mind if I test it first, do you? Wait just a moment...<br>

I'm sorry, but I have no use for this item. It only does simple arithmetic! I suppose you did your part, however, so I will fulfill my end of our bargain.<br>
Here is 1500 Ade... Ah! Perhaps you would rather have the calculator? I will be happy to give it to you. You can either take the calculator or accept 1500 Adena.<br>
