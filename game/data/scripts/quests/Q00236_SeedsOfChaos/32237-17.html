The future is a blank canvass. If you master the abilities with the Sword that symbolize the skill of male Kamael, the abilities with the Bow that symbolize the skill of female Kamael, and the magical abilities that are available to our entire race, perhaps another path will be opened to you.<br>
In any case, you have kept our second promise to the woman in blue. You will create mighty warriors by overcoming the limitations imposed on our race... That was our pledge to her.<br>
Now go and find the Grand Masters of our race. They will tell you about the path that was previously closed to you. May fortune shine upon you all your days...<br>
