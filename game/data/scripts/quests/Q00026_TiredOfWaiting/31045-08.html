The <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Blood Crystal</font> is formed over time from Antharas's spilled blood.<br>
His blood has lost its magic power, but if you combine it with <font color="LEVEL">Will of Antharas</font>, you can still obtain an item with tremendous magic power. Use it, and you will be able to <font color="LEVEL">resurrect several people simultaneously.</font><br>
This Sealed Blood Crystal can be obtained by hunting the <font color="LEVEL">Drake Lord, Behemoth Leader, and Dragon Beast</font> inside Antharas' Lair.<br>
