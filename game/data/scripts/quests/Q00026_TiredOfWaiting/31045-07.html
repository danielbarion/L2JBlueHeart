<font color="LEVEL">Will of Antharas</font> is a command stone that Antharas implanted into its mostly powerful subordinates, thus gaining control over their movements.<br>
It is also a tool that maximizes the magic powers of Antharas's Subordinates. If you were to combine it with a <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Blood Crystal</font>, you could obtain an item with tremendous magic power. For instance, by using it, you can <font color="LEVEL">resurrect multiple people simultaneously!</font><br>
Will of Antharas can be obtained by hunting the <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bleeding Fly, Blackdagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, and Muscle Bomber</font>, which can be summoned from the Dragon Vortex in Dragon Valley.<br>
