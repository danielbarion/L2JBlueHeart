<html><body>Tantan:<br>
Ah-ha! You're a novice adventurer... I haven't met anyone like you on the plains for a long time. I'm Tantan. I may be old now, but in my day, I was a famous adventurer! You've heard of me, haven't you? Those young fellows in the village say I'm making it all up! Youngsters these days are just plain rude! So, I've come all the way out here to catch some monsters to show them. I'm out of Soulshots, and my strength is not what it used to be... I'm in a bit of a fix...<br>
If you were a little more experienced, I would've asked for your help.<br>
Take care of yourself.<br>
