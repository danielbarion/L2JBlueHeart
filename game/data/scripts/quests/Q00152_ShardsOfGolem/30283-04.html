So this is the Golem Shard ... Similar to diamond, but more dense and thus very hard. It will take some time to polish and carve this shard, so would you wait a moment?<br>
All I have to do is polish this Golem Shard a bit with a Mithril hammer and fix it firmly to this wooden handle that I've already made. Wonderful! Finished! It may look a bit coarse, but no other tool can compare to this. Try it! Quite heavy, eh?<br>
Here, this is a toolbox that contains the tools that Magister Harrys has asked for. It includes the hammer that I just made from the Golem Shard, as well as nails, a saw, and various other equipment. Go and deliver them to <font color="LEVEL">him</font>.
