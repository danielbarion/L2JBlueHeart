<html><body>Soldier Orbyu:<br>
Ah! Thank you! You are the answer to our prayers.<br>
I won't lie to you -- this is going to be a very difficult mission. Before you go, I'd advise you to go talk to <font color="LEVEL">Soldier El</font>. He accompanied a group of researchers into the Seed of Destruction. He is the only person, in fact, who has been to the deepest dungeon of the Seed of Destruction and come back alive. Others...have not been as fortunate.<br>
You can find Soldier El in the center of the fortress.
