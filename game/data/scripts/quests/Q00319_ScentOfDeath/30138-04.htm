The Nightshade needs Zombie Dust as fertilizer. Zombie Dust is made by drying the skins of corpses and grinding them into powder. It will have a stronger effect if it's made with an old corpse. Tetrarch Vellior told me he uses the skins of the undead for best effect.<br>
I need a favor from you. If you go to the <font color="LEVEL">Marshlands</font> southwest of our village, you'll find <font color="LEVEL">Zombies of the Tree Elves</font>, long dead after our race wiped them out. Go after them and bring back their <font color="LEVEL">Zombie Skins.</font> If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">five</font> of them, I will give you a reward.
