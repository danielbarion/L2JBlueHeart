I will tell you about the area you will enter and what you must do there.<br>
You will enter Hall of Erosion, which consists of a interconnected set of 8 rooms. There are <font color="LEVEL">Tumors of Death</font> in 4 of those rooms. You must destroy those Tumors.<br>
Once you have done so, <font color="LEVEL">Cohemenes</font> will appear.
