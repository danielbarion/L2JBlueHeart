Our Kamael Steelfile is different from other combat groups. We are a special force particularly suited for information gathering, reporting, determining an enemy's weaknesses, interrogating, attacking supply lines and conducting raids behind enemy lines.<br>
These activities suit the natural abilities of female Kamael, which is why our unit was formed.<br>
Our Steelfile exam is no different... We will examine your skills to see if and where you would fit into our overall strategy...<br>
We have a good mission available for your test. Do your best!<br>
