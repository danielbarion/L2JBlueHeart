Ah, you've brought it! Well done!<br>
I can already feel the sacred energy of the Mother Tree in this powder. Now we have a chance to defeat Tiat.<br>
Of course, it is still not in a very practical form. Go to <font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font> and ask him to turn this powder into a solid weapon. If anyone can do it, he can. Hurry!
