<html><body>War Mage Artius:<br>
The power of the Dark Black Dragon is extremely potent. If she somehow acquired the power, she will be a formidable adversary. But there may be a chance... We must act quickly.<br>
I will explain more later. Right now, you must go to the Seed of Destruction, hunt members of the Mounted Troop, and bring me <font color="LEVEL">Powders of Broken Darkness</font>. We will purify it into a weapon we can use against Tiat. We must at least have <font color="LEVEL">100</font> Powders of Broken Darkness. Now hurry -- there is no time to waste!
