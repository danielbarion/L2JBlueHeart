It concerns a girl dressed in witch's clothing who apparently controls the Fleet Steed Troop. See here!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The Mounted Troop seems to be a group of soldiers controlled by someone called Tiat. Interesting... How can such a formidable group follow such a slight girl? Ah, she is surrounded by infernal energy... Hmm...</font> Apparently our team was discovered by the Mounted Troop while recording this last part. After this, the text is nearly illegible. I can only make out the words "Tiat," "magic power," and "transformation."<br>
I don't like it, but I think we need that fellow's help in this matter...<br>
