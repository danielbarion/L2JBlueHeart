Yes, I checked the necessary items. It must have been difficult to obtain them all!<br>
I must warn you that I do not know for sure what kind of power posessed by each bracelet. I only can tell you that the Angel's Bracelet contains an angel-type Agathion, while the Devil's Bracelet contains a devil-type Agathion. You must discover the capability and magic power of each on your own.<br>
Here, please take this as an extra token of my appreciation for your business...<br>
(I have a strange feeling about that bracelet -- I hope this adventurer will simply take this and leave here immediately.)
