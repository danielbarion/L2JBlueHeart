Is this a Freya Necklace? Hmm... it's okay I guess. It isn't as interesting as a Blessed Freya Necklace. You could be lucky enough to get one, or if you happen to aquire Freya's Soul in a bottle you can create a Blessed Freya Necklace. However the process is, well... different. Tell you what, if you bring me these items I can make one for you.<br>
