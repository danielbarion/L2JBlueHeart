Welcome to my little oasis. Although it may be cold and blustery out there, it's like an endless spring day in here. Needless to say, I don't really venture outside much any more. Although I like my privacy, I'm always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. And if you don't mind me saying, you look like you're in need.<br>
