<html><body>Treasure seeker Sumiel:<br>
Success! You've found this room, wandered around this Monastery of Silence for a long time, got lost, got hungry, found your way here now, haven't you? Trust me when I say I don't know where the treasure is. I'd be long gone if I did. But I've had time to look, and I think there is a connection in the turning order of this furnace... I think we can solve the puzzle if we have an item to light. Do you want to give it a try? Tricky part is this, we have to light it within a certain time...<br>
