<html><body>Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br>
The cost is high if you wish to keep the <font color="LEVEL">ancient Adena</font> from corroding. I'm sure you won't like it, but you must pay 4 times the normal cost. Also, we only see in bundles of 500,000 ancient Adena.<br>
To make sure the ancient currency is spread widely, we have limited the amount that an individual can buy per day.<br>
Have you decided to buy?<br>
