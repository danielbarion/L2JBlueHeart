Activate the trap that is located in the inner part of the island. Then, the trap function produces a magical fire that emanates from the device, slowing movement of those passing above it and setting them afire.<br>
This device has the same effect on allies so it must be carefully deployed... Used correctly there is no greater defense for a castle.<br>
Of course, quality has its price...<br><br>
