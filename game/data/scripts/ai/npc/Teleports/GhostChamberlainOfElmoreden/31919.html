<html><body>Elmoreden Chamberlain's Ghost:<br>
Greetings! I am a chamberlain of the ancient Elmoreden empire! When I was a mortal being, I worked at the cemetery of the Elmoreden empire. Now I'm here, serving those who are traveling to the cemetery.<br>
My assistant also assists such travelers. He can be found near the entrance of Argos' Wall<br>
Do you plan to visit the Imperial Tomb?<br>
