<html><body>Elmoreden Servant's Ghost:<br>
Woooo! I'm a ghost servant of the ancient Elmoreden Empire! I worked in the cemetery when I was a mortal being. Now I'm here to help travelers going to the Imperial Tomb.<br>
My boss is in the Pilgrim's Temple. He also helps people visit the cemetery.<br>
Would you like to visit the Imperial Tomb of Elmoreden?<br>
