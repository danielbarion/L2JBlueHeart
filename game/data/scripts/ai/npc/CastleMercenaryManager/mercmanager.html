Greetings, my Lord. Would you care to hire the mercenaries of our guild?<br>
Although you have already signed a Contract with special mercenaries who were after the Seal of Strife previously, you will not be able to place them unless they belong to our guild.<br> 
If you don't know how to draw up a Contract, just ask me.<br>
