To become a Berserker, you need the recommendation of Master Olkrus.<br>
If you are not at least level 40, however, his recommendation will do you no good.<br>
All other requirements or exams are in Olkrus' hands, so ask him for a thorough explanation.<br>
If you are not at least level 39, do not even bother speaking with him.<br>
