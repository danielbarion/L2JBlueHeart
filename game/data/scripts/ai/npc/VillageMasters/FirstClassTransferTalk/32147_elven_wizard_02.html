<html><body>Grand Master Rivian:<br>
To become an Elven Wizard, you must be at least level 20 and have passed the test. An Elf named <font color="LEVEL">Rosella in the Elven Village</font> can set your feet on the path to becoming an Elven Wizard. Do you still have the Newbie Travel Token? Show it to Rosella and she will send you to the Elven Village.<br>
Even after you demonstrated your qualifications, though, the class change is not possible here -- this place is designed only to train beginners up to a certain skill level. You must go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio on the mainland</font> to become an Elven Wizard. Seek out <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Raymond</font> in the Temple in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>.<br>
