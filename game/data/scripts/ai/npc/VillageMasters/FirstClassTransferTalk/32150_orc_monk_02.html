<html><body>High Perfect Took:<br>
To meet the qualifications for an Orc Monk, you must have at least achieved level 20 and passed the Orc Monk test.<br>
However, even if you meet those basic qualifications, I cannot transfer you. Only those who have experienced Human society and understand the great world beyond the plateau are qualified to make the class transfer. "Know the enemy as you know yourself, and you will be invincible in battle," the sages say.<br>
To take the Orc Monk test, go to <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu</font> in the Orc Village. Then journey to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font> in Gludio Territory and meet <font color="LEVEL">High Prefect Osborn</font>. If you are qualified, he will transfer you.<br>
