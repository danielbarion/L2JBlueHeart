In order to transfer to a Wizard, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the Wizard test. But even though you have passed the test, you cannot transfer here. It is important that those who embrace a new profession have experienced some of the world.<br>
To transfer, you should journey to the Kingdom of Aden. Go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font> and visit the temple there, where you will meet <font color="LEVEL">High Priestess Levian</font>. She will test your ability, and if she determines that you are ready, she will permit the transfer.<br>
Alternately, you can visit <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Raymond in the town of Gludio</font>, east of Gludin Village.<br>
