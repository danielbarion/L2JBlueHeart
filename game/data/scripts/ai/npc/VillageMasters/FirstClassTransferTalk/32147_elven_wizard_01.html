<font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizards</font> use elemental magic, dark magic and summonings more powerful than those of the Elven Mages. They command fire and wind, harness the magical power of the darkness and summon spirits of the nature as Servitors.<br>
The most powerful Elven Wizards may become <font color="LEVEL">Spellsingers</font>, who have an improved affinity with the spirits, or <font color="LEVEL">Elemental Summoners</font>.<br>
