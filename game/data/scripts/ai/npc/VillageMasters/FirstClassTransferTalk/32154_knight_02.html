<html><body>Grand Master Aldenia:<br>
In order to become a Knight, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the Knight test. But, as I mentioned before, you cannot transfer here.<br>
You must go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>. <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Ramos</font> in Gludin Village or <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Rains</font> in Gludio Castle in the eastern part of Gludin Village will test your qualifications and, if he deems you worthy, transfer your occupation to Knight.<br>
