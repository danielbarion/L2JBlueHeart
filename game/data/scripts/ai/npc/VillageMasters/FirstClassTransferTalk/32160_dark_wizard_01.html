<html><body>Grand Magister Devon:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Dark Wizards</font> command more powerful spirits and use more powerful magic than Dark Mages, as well as stronger elemental magic, dark magic and summon magic. At their whim, fire and wind may attack an enemy, a curse may descend on their counterparts or deprive them of their vitality. They may also summon the spirits sleeping in the dark as "Servitors."<br>
Some Dark Wizards may choose to study elemental magic in greater depth as <font color="LEVEL">Spell Howlers</font>, or focus on summoning magic by becoming <font color="LEVEL">Phantom Summoners</font>.<br>
