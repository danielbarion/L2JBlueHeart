A class transfer occurs when someone with the necessary abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. Unfortunately, you cannot complete the transfer here. However, I can give you the information you need to do so. If you are an Elven Mage, you can transfer to <font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizard</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Oracle</font>. Which would you like to know more about?<br>
