<html><body>High Priest Prana:<br>
You have already completed a class transfer, and your strength is plain to see. I can give no further advice to someone like you. I can only hope that you will use your power in the service of Einhasad, mother of all good, to benefit the weak and poor. May the light of Einhasad always light your path.
