To meet the qualifications for Scavenger, you must have at least achieved level 20 and have passed the Scavenger test.<br>
However, even those basic requirements aren't enough -- only those who understand the great world beyond the plateau are truly qualified to complete a class transfer and become empowered to control the world's economy.<br>
To take the test, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Collector Pippi</font> of the Bronze Key Guild in the Dwarven Village.<br>
She will tell you everything you need to know. Once you have met the qualifications, go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Moke</font>. If he deems you worthy, he will transfer you to Scavenger.<br>
