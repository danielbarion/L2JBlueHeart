The fundamental characteristics of <font color="LEVEL">Artisans</font> and Scavengers are that the Scavengers collect rare materials and then Artisans make something valuable from those materials. For this reason, Artisans use their own powers in combat, often summoning Golems. In addition, they tend to fight with items of their own creation that they normally use for hunting.<br>Exceptionally skilled Artisans may be elected as <font color="LEVEL">Warsmiths</font>, exalted craftsmen whose manufacturing skills are of the highest level -- they can even create siege golems.<br>
