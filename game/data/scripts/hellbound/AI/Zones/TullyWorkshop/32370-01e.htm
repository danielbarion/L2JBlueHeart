<html><body>Old Dwarven Ghost:<br>
The Tombstone is...a complicated 5-stage mechanism... It has a built-in...safety lock device... To release the device, you need each key... You need <font color="LEVEL">5 small metal medals</font>.<br>
Those medals...can be found...somewhere in this maze...<br>
The medal's unique owner recognition device won't allow one person to have more than one medal...so don't go looking for the medals...by yourself...<br>
