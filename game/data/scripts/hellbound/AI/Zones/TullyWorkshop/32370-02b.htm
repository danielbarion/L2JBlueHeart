Because the exterior of this lock...is the super metal Tolecium...it is virtually invicible...to physical attack... However, it is...very <font color="LEVEL">sensitive to attribute energy</font>...If it is continually exposed to...energy with nature attributes...its surface will be temporarily weakened... Below 1/10, the different energy intensities...between the exterior...and the interior...may cause a strong...extruding effect.<br>
If you are lucky...you can take advantage of that effect...to enter the Tower of Naia...<br>
