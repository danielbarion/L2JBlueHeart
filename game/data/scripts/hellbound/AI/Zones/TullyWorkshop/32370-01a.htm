<html><body>Old Dwarven Ghost:<br>
I was...enticed by those devils...and built this castle for them...but their greed did not stop there... They stole my soul and made me their slave forever...<br>
The body you just destroyed...was only a shell... This castle and I have become one... I cannot die even if I want to...<br>
My soul is watched by Darion...who resides atop <font color="LEVEL">this tower</font>... Please destroy him...so that I... can finally rest in peace...<br>
