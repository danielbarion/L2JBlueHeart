<html><body>Old Dwarven Ghost:<br>
You're here...<br>
Dark magic was forced in...and is slowly rotting this place...within the Tower... It has altered it...from my original design... I wish I could help you... I knew you would come here...after overcoming the barriers...<br>
But you cannot relax yet... The most formidable obstacle still awaits you... Before you face the final trial...listen to this old man's advice, I pray...<br>
