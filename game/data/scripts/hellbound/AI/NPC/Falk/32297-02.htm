I'm not asking anything particularly difficult, but I do need a favor from you, my friend. We in the Caravan travel to and through many places on this island, which requires a great many of Darion's Badges. Although we are able to lay our hands on some, they are simply not enough for us to turn a profit, even considering the natives' unquenching demand for Prayer Fragments... If you can spare any Darion's Badges, please give them to me. I don't need that many -- even 20 will suffice. In return, I will give you a voucher that will allow you trade with the Caravan members.<br>
