I hear that the outer gates have fallen and our forces are steadily advancing into the Steel Citadel! There is a rumor that the Dwarf who designed the 
Steel Citadel still resides somewhere inside the castle. Many of our brethren also live in the Oasis or in the town located within the castle walls. 
Please save them! If you have any of Darion's Badges, you should be able to travel anywhere without restrictions.
