I've learned why even the money-hungry caravans fear to go to the Scarred Plateau. How can such a terrible place exist... I have not been there myself, 
but they say that it is inhabited by terrible monsters. That said, apparently it is possible to obtain Magic Spirits from those monsters, 
for which foreign magicians will pay a steep price. If you could capture some for us, we would be in your debt.
