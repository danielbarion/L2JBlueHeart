Oh, the Natives asked you to do that? Well, I certainly sympathize with their situation, but we are traders after all. You could say that give-and-take is the natural order of things! I actually have a favor to ask of you. I don't know about the Natives, but I am sure that you can manage this task.<br>
If you go north from here, you will find a place where minerals are unearthed for Darion. It is called The Quarry, and many of our people have been enslaved there, forced to dig and mine. Please free them! It would be even better if you could free the Caravan village, but that is a long and arduous journey. Take the freed slaves to the Dolmen at the entrance to the Quarry. The Natives regard it as a sacred spot, but we frequently use it for navigation. Once there, we will be able to take care of them.<br>
The Quarry guards have orders to kill any slave that tries to escape. You must at all costs protect our people from that fate! Avoid the guards and safeguard our people to freedom.<br>
