I hear that the Natives' village is often attacked these days. I don't know how the Natives gathered all those treasures and hid them, but that's what the Keltas are after. Do me a favor and bring me that treasure before it's all plundered. The compensation will be more than adequate, I promise you. Bring me 40 Native Treasures as fast as you can.<br>
