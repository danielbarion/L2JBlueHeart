I've heard that that the Resistance and the mainlanders have pushed the Devils all the way back to the Steel Citadel's outer gates! 
Breaching the gates is now just a matter of time. True, one of the enemy's captains has made a stand before gates, but the combined strength of our 
forces should be enough to defeat even him!
