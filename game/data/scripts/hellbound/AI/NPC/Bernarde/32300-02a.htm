I have a favor to ask of you. You are aware, are you not, that my ancestors in the Ancient Temple Remnants are not at peace? It is a great tragedy... 
However, you can give them the rest they deserve by spraying this holy water. Are your ancestors there, too? Take this holy water, I beg you, 
to the ruins and use it to lay the spirits of the seers to rest. There are so many foreigners here these days that it has been difficult to find someone 
willing to take on this mission...<br>
