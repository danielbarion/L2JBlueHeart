I've learned why the Scarred Plateau was abandoned, why even the money-hungry caravans fear to go there. Perhaps, once you've fully prepared yourself, 
you'd care to investigate for yourself? It is said that you can use a Magic Bottle to capture Magic Spirits from the monsters there, 
which in turn are very valuable to magicians overseas. Why not try it?
