This magical bottle was created by the magicians of the Ivory Tower, who are frequent visitors to Hellbound. It was designed to be used against the monsters of the Battered Lands. Those creatures possess powerful magic, but if they become physically weakened, you can use the bottle to capture their magic power. Remember, they must be weakened first! Nevertheless, I think it is a risk worth running. The Ivory Tower magicians are eager to research these magical spirits ? these creatures may have been failures, but they were still created by Beleth, after all, and their magic is still powerful. Will you attempt to collect some of these magical spirits? If so, I will be happpy to provide you with this magical bottle for just 20 Scorpion Poison Stingers. I wish I could give it to you for free, but since I must pay the Ivory Tower magicians for it, I'm afraid I must charge a small fee.<br>
