<html> <body> Pathfinder: <br>
First, I'll tell you about the enemies. <font color="LEVEL"> Kanabion </font> - not just a monster, a creature that appeared as a result of the connection of evil and darkness. <br>
Our goal - to destroy them and prevent the spread Kamaloki the territory of Aden. <br>
If you kill enough Kanabionov, then we'll give you some ammunition. In time we'll assign you a rank <font color="LEVEL"> from D to S </font> depending on your results. <br>
Or we can return collected by you from Kanabionov <font color="LEVEL"> Essences Kanabionov </font>. But in the real world there are no places where you can take advantage of them. <br>
Give them to us, if you think that you do not need. We offer appropriate compensation. <br>
And if you die around Kamaloki, no one can help you before time runs out or stay until the moment when all will be defeated. It's your dream. <br>
Thus, our technology will allow you to be around Kamaloki within <font color="LEVEL"> 20 minutes </font>. Do not forget about it.
