Hellbound Traitor:<br>
Kuhh! You are pretty clever. The Steel Citadel values people of talent like you.<br>
Look here, you will be rewarded for killing the captain of the Hellbound rebels, but what about me? Don't you think that I deserve a little payment?<br>
What I need is 10 <font color="LEVEL">Marks of Betrayal</font>.<br>
Bring me those and I'll gladly open this door.<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest Natives open_door">Tell him that you have them.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 4">Threaten him into opening the door immediately.</a>
