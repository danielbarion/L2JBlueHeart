<html><body>Blacksmith of Mammon:<br>
May Mammon's blessing be upon you! I have come down to this deep underground world in order to offer you the highest quality weapons.<br>
I will take care of your weapons and armor with skill that cannot be matched by inexperienced blacksmiths.<br>
I just have one request: we dwarves of Mammon do not accept money from the outside world, so if you want to trade with us, you must prepare <font color="LEVEL">ancient adena</font>.<br>
Also, be aware that from now on, the seal removal of A-grade items can only be done by the <font color="LEVEL">blacksmiths</font> of each town.<br>
