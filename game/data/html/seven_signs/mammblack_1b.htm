I will exchange the weapon for another type of the same grade. For example, you can exchange a mithril dagger for a two-handed claymore of the same grade. But, I have to warn you.<br>
First, weapons with <font color="LEVEL">special abilities</font> cannot be exchanged.<br>
Second, when exchanging a weapon that has been <font color="LEVEL">enchanted</font> the exchanged weapon will have the same enchantment.<br>
